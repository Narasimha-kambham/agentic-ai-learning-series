            "    *   In 2005, he co-founded Y Combinator with Jessica Livingston (his wife), Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell.\n",
            "    *   YC revolutionized startup funding and mentorship by providing seed funding, advice, and a powerful network to thousands of startups in batches.\n",
            "    *   It has funded and mentored some of the most successful tech companies in the world, including **Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Coinbase, DoorDash, and many more.**\n",
            "    *   Graham stepped down from day-to-day management of YC in 2014 but remains a partner and advisor.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Entrepreneur (Viaweb):**\n",
            "    *   Before YC, Graham co-founded **Viaweb** in 1995 with Robert Morris.\n",
            "    *   Viaweb was one of the first web-based applications for building online stores, written in the Lisp programming language.\n",
            "    *   It was acquired by Yahoo! in 1998 for $49 million in stock, becoming Yahoo! Store. This successful exit provided him with the capital and experience to later launch Y Combinator.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Programmer and Lisp Advocate:**\n",
            "    *   Graham is a strong advocate for the Lisp programming language. His early work and writings often explored the power and elegance of Lisp.\n",
            "    *   He authored the influential book **\"On Lisp\"** (1993), which is a classic in the Lisp community.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Essayist and Author:**\n",
            "    *   Paul Graham is a prolific and highly influential essayist. His essays, published on his website (paulgraham.com), cover a wide range of topics including startups, programming, technology, culture, wealth, and more.\n",
            "    *   He is known for his clear, insightful, and often provocative style, which has shaped the thinking of countless entrepreneurs, programmers, and technologists.\n",
            "    *   Many of his essays are collected in his books, most notably **\"Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age\"** (2004).\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary:** Paul Graham is a pivotal figure in the modern tech and startup world. Through Y Combinator, he helped democratize startup funding and provided a blueprint for accelerator models worldwide. His entrepreneurial success with Viaweb and his widely read essays have also profoundly influenced the culture and philosophy of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n"
